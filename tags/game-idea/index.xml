      <description>As I understand, music is like language. You have this written notation that you can translate to sound with a device — vocal cords and musical instruments. Sound that your brain interprets as concepts in your mind.
Composers and writers are wizards that translate concepts in their minds to these concrete written runes that, once spoken, or played through magical instruments, convey meaning — notes and melodies. Music.
When I learned to play the keyboard, I could translate the written notation directly into the equivalent notes on the instrument and slowly learn to play a song by sheer repetition.</description>
