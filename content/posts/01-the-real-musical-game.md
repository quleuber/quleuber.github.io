As I understand, music is like language. You have this written notation that you
can translate to sound with a device — vocal cords and musical instruments.
Sound that your brain interprets as concepts in your mind.

Composers and writers are wizards that translate concepts in their minds to
these concrete written runes that, once spoken, or played through magical
instruments, convey meaning — notes and melodies. *Music*.

When I learned to play the keyboard, I could translate the written notation
directly into the equivalent notes on the instrument and slowly learn to play a
song by sheer repetition. While I could play some decent stuff, being able to do
only that was still equivalent to being illiterate.

You know the alphabet and can *slowly* translate the letters and syllables to
sounds and words; you can even memorize an *entire speech*. But you are not
*really using* the language: you can't translate the concepts in your mind into
sentences and paragraphs. i.e. melodies, chord sequences etc.

And that is *boring*.

While you can train the essential skill of understanding notes in the context of
the key through something like the [Functional Year
Training](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaizen9.fet.android)
app. The problem with that is **[describe how it's unsustainably boring and a
failed with it and how a video game would solve that]**

Most musical games are rhythm games, ala Guitar Hero, Osu and Crypt of the
Necrodancer. **[write about how Rocksmith is still the same thing I'm describing
above]**.

I'm proposing the *Real Musical Game*, where you play with *actual music*:
notes, intervals, melodies, chords, and harmonies. Some loose ideas about how
the design could be:

- Notes are simple attacks, and melodies are combos.
- Specific melodies cast spells (ala Magicka) or counter specific enemies (ala
  Crypt of the Necrodancer).
- Chords progressions set the "mode" of action somehow.
- Minor chords have a slightly different effect than major chords.
- The more harmony, the more effective your actions. But a pinch of disharmony
  would have some interesting usable effect — perhaps a "cursed" one.
- Playing the sample sound of Mario mushroom spawns a magic mushroom. We can
  expand this concept to an entire gameplay system, ala Scribblenauts.

Ideally, we would build the base gameplay on the fundamental elements of music,
and we would be free to combine them with fairly consistent rules. We then form
ever more intricate patterns resulting in combined and specific effects,
allowing exploration and discovery, ala Magicka. It should be such a way that
playing an entire *song* would make sense and simply work — it would be
equivalent to playing it on Very Hard mode.

While I acknowledge it may require immense amounts of computer cleverness to
make this work, with the current IA revolution happening, there may be a
not-that-hard way to make the game "understand" most arbitrary musical inputs
from the user. And the result would be, sincerely, *pure gold*.
