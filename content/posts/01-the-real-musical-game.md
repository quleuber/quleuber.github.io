As I understand, music is like language. You have this written notation that you
can translate to sound with a device —  vocal cords and musical instruments.
Sound that your brain interprets as concepts in your mind.

Composers and writers are wizards that translate concepts in their minds to
these concrete written runes that, once spoken, or played through magical
instruments, convey meaning —  notes and melodies. _Music_.

When I learned to play the keyboard, I could translate the written notation
directly into the equivalent notes on the instrument and slowly learn to play a
song by sheer repetition. While I could play some decent stuff, being able to do
only that was still equivalent to being illiterate.

You know the alphabet and can _slowly_ translate the letters and syllables to
sounds and words; you can even memorize an _entire speech_. But you are not
_really using_ the language: you can't translate the concepts in your mind into
sentences and paragraphs, i.e. melodies, chord sequences, etc.

And that is _lame_.

While you can train the essential skill of understanding notes in the context of
the key through something like the [Functional Year Training app, I found a big
problem with that approach: it's _very boring_. There's this big skill gap where
you can't do anything interesting with the first intervals you learn. I get no
joy with it. (well... this probably happens with most skills, but ok).

My gaming-programming-dopamine-flooded brain can't keep up with learning these
very basic intervals _for months_ until I can do something interesting with them.
Then, I realized that not only we can make _real_ game out of this, but it
could be __extremely fun__.

We have a bunch of musical games that are rhythm-based. Guitar Hero, Osu!, Crypt
of the Necrodancer, Beat Saber, you name it. While being great, they have
nothing to do with the skill I'm describing (understanding the actual notes,
relative pitch, etc). Rocksmith goes a step further: you play actual notes with
a real instrument. But it falls for the same problem I described above: you are
only mechanically translating the notes; no need to understand them.

What I'm proposing is the _Real Musical Game_, where you play with _actual
music_: notes, melodies, chords, and harmonies. You start with single
notes and then progress slowly, learning the small intervals and so on.

Some loose ideas about how the design could be:

- Notes are simple attacks, and melodies are combos.
- Chords progressions set the "mode" of action somehow.
- Minor chords have a slightly different effect than major chords.
- The more harmony, the more effective your actions. But a pinch of disharmony
  would have some interesting usable effect —  perhaps a "cursed" one.
- Specific melodies cast spells (ala Magicka) or counter specific enemies (ala
  Crypt of the Necrodancer).
- Playing the sample sound of Mario mushroom spawns a magic mushroom. We can
  expand this concept to an entire gameplay system, ala Scribblenauts.

Ideally, we would build the base gameplay on the fundamental elements of music,
and we would be free to combine them with fairly consistent rules. We form ever
more intricate patterns resulting in combined and specific effects, allowing
exploration and discovery. It should be in such a way that playing an entire
_song_ would make sense and just work — it would be equivalent to playing it on
Very Hard mode.

While I acknowledge it may require significant amounts of computer cleverness to
make this work, with the current IA revolution happening, there may be a
not-that-hard way to make the game "understand" most arbitrary musical inputs
from the user and procedurally generate challenges. And the result would be,
sincerely, _pure gold_.
